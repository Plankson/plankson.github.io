Hello! I am Yunpeng Qing, a first-year M.Sc. student in the [Visual Intelligence and Pattern Analysis (VIPA) Lab](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) @ [ZheJiang University (ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), advised by Professor [Mingli Song](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/msong). In the past, I have received my B.E. degree from [the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/) in 2023.6.

Currently my reseach interests lies on **Reinforcement Learning**, especially on **Offline Reinforcement Learning**. My overarching goal is to create a robust and reliable general framework for agent to effectively recognize and sequential sequantial decision-making informations data. To this end, my prior work has been dedicated to devising methods that facilitate the application of reinforcement learning algorithms on a variety of static datasets.  

Please always feel free to contact me via [**yunpeng.qing.cs@gmail.com**](mailto:yunpeng.qing.cs@gmail.com) if you have any questions, are interested in collaborating, or just want to chat.
